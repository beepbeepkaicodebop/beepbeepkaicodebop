<p align="center">It's been quite a while since I last used my own (aka <i>this</i>) gh profile due to using corps one and stuff, so please don't mind the dust. But I plan to change it soon and come back with new random little projects and content, so stay tuned, and I'm all ears for tips on getting rid of those cobwebs!</p>

> `and others I'm getting tired of editing this template and looking for the icons to replace lol`

> **Summary?** Basically, backend/frontend and their tools with cloud experiences with a focus on AWS, playing with SRE, the Data ~World and their tools, trying to learn architecture and mainly to keep on improving my knowledge on this rollercoaster of fast changes!

## 🖋 What else should I say here?!
DM me on LinkedIn or say hi on Twitter, alright?

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on...** myself, I hope. Projects change, and so do stacks, but it's been mainly backend work with hopefully a frontend task here and there.
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning...** to not be so anxious! (improving my biz - now I'm a Computer Science student, uhuhhhhhh!)
- 👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will have a positive impact on society, whether where I live or anywhere else. Let's create something from scratch, or call me if you have something in mind! If I don't have the necessary tech skills, I'll learn them!
- 🤔 **I’m looking for help with...** carreer mentoring, basically. I need to know my worth and learn how to negotiate it. I'd also like to learn new languages; I only speak two and a half.
- 💬 **Ask me about...** almost anything as long as you don't disrespect me, but chances are I won't reply anyway, so mind your language and the topic for higher rates of replies, alright?
- 📫 **How to reach me?** LinkedIn might be a better bet, I guess? I'm constantly changing usernames/handlers/whatever the kids call it these days.
- 😄 **Pronouns:** Call me Jay or Kai, and we're good.
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** Damn, I got none... How could I know what'd be fun to you? Lmao We can talk and find it out (if you're a recruiter, HAHAHA)
