🔭 **I’m currently working on:** <br>
- _myself_.


>  As I recover from a hardcore burnout ignored long enough to find myself in unrecognisable ashes and this gh crowded by cobwebs, this has been my main —— and for the most part, the only —— project.

In spite of how much it may sound like some flimsy excuse or another cheap cliché preached by and to the losers going bonkers, I'm finally learning and accepting the need and impact of working on myself by moving it to the DOING column, claiming this WIP, and all else it entails.

<br>

> >So please don't mind the dust all over this old mess.
> > I plan to change it as I step further toward recovery and myself.

Taking this wild ride along these roads made of quicksand against concrete has been a rollercoaster of _learning and failing countless old and new lessons_ from which many I can _apply on my following adventures, **creating and fixing solutions**_.

> While I hope I'm picking up the habit of successfully and frequently closing as much of the tasks required to perform **the most prestigious and crucial of roles**, and, yet, often looked down upon —— _that of an actual living creature_ ——, I **am aware** of how much the description and benefits can _pale in comparison_ to the others.

When faced with **supposedly** opposing roles, the shiny happy package takes the spot regardless of what hides under all the wrapping.


It is no surprise that `demands like prioritising the ongoing care, upkeep, and development of my hardware, OS and apps as the current KPI and not guilt-tripping over it rarely make it to the backlog column.`

There is no space for such stories when the releases are a looping film of permanently urgent priorities exponentially raising the mindless grinding points behind each sprint carried by `the silent and long-established general despair` to get it, make it, and keep it, and `its unspoken rule` of unlimited sacrifice despite the stakes and load _de facto_.


This concept is so intertwined in us that it becomes **one of the few plausible common denominators across people from all scraps across the scope**.


> The **mindsets and the life behind them** are brought to you by the creators of the worldwide hit _“Work While They Sleep"_ and sponsored by the long-running success _“No Pain, No Gain"_ producers —— or whatever similar cliché is trending while you read it —— and they **do sound way more promising** than anything remotely related to this equally banal talk of self-care, etc.

> **I know**. I've been there, done that.

And even so, _time and again_, I _roam back_ to these corners and for a much longer stay than I should by now. **Despite the realisation, I'm still just another naive pixel in the picture of a tale as old as the time of this common denominator target.** `We are, after all, a WIP in the line of the evolution and with no deadline`, innit? 


Nonetheless, I'm finally `getting around these overwhelming highways and crowded crossroads without falling inside another expertly hidden hole every few steps`.
> After climbing down some _Godzilla hills_, **I can catch glimpses somewhere on the misty horizon of my love for this activity and _the whys_**.


_**Therefore**_, all this nonsense cliché has obviously been proven reasonable and essential for survival and thriving in these waters, and to turn the tides from workaholic mindsets towards `higher, prettier, and healthier waves crashing consistently against all shores, I shall set my heart to.`

  With all that being said, I am currently working on myself and plan to keep doing so, <br>
  especially as I work on the fantastic projects and creations to come!
